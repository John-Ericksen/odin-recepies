    <p><b> General Tso’s 
        Chicken is that perfect combination of sweet, savoury,
         spicy and tangy with crispy Chinese chicken bites. It’s a
          Chinese takeout favourite that just pushes all the right 
          buttons!</b></p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Maranade</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        
    <ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauce/Marinade – 
            first, mix the Sauce/Marinade. We do this in two parts. 
            Firstly, mix all the ingredients except the sugar, chicken 
            stock/broth and the cornflour/cornstarch, and use some of 
            this initial mix to marinate the chicken (in Step 2 below). 
            THEN mix in the sugar, stock and cornflour to the remainder 
            to create the dish’s final Sauce – these are Sauce-specific 
            ingredients we don’t want in the chicken marinade;
            Marinate Chicken – Use 2 tablespoons of the initial Sauce mix 
            to marinate the chicken for 30 minutes along with fresh garlic 
            and ginger. It’s really nice to add fresh ginger and garlic into 
            the marinade to really get those flavours into the chicken;</li>

        <li>Coat chicken in cornflour – just add it into the bowl and mix, 
            making sure the pieces are separate so they are fully coated;
            Shake off excess cornflour using whatever method works for you
             – I use a colander these days. Not all the cornflour falls 
             through the colander holes and that’s ok. It still gives me 
             a means to shake out most of the excess and some chunks settled
              at the base. We don’t want a thick layer of cornflour on the
               chicken because it can make it taste powdery and also you end up with loads of cornflour in the oil which burns unless you scoop it out;</li>
        <li>Cook chicken using preferred amount of oil – 
            either shallow fry as I do (which is when the chicken is
             sitting on the base of the pan and the oil comes halfway up
              the chicken) or deep fry (which is when there is enough oil 
              so the chicken floats around in the oil). You can even cook 
              it with just a thin layer of oil in the pan but you’ll need 
              to rotate each piece of chicken 4 to 6 times to get all sides
               crispy – which is a pain! Drain on paper towels to remove
                excess oil. </li>
